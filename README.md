# CommandBridge
Send Spigot command to BungeeCord!

## Under Rewrite
This plugin is now under rewrite, there will be a huge change after the rewrite.  
Next Release: 2020/01/25 est.  

## Introduction
This is my first plugin published on SpigotMC. Hope you can enjoy it!

This plugin allows you to use a single command(player cannot execute) to send to a BungeeCord instance.

__Example:__
You have 2 servers:a BungeeCord server and a Spigot server, installed CommandBridge - BungeeCord and CommandBridge - Spigot.  
If you want to use a Spigot plugin(such as AuthMe, AntiCheat, etc.) to send a command to BungeeCord(e.g. `/alert helloworld`), all you have to do is just simply type a `/sendcmd alert helloworld` into the config section, and the BungeeCord will execute the command you invoked.
