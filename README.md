# CommandBridge
Send Spigot command to BungeeCord!

## Introduction
This is my first plugin published on SpigotMC. Hope you can enjoy it!

This plugin allows you to use a single command(player cannot execute) to send to a BungeeCord instance.

__Example:__
You have 2 servers:a BungeeCord server and a Spigot server, installed CommandBridge - BungeeCord and CommandBridge - Spigot.  
If you want to use a Spigot plugin(such as AuthMe, AntiCheat, etc.) to send a command to BungeeCord(e.g. `/alert helloworld`), all you have to do is just simply type a `/sendcmd alert helloworld` into the config section, and the BungeeCord will execute the command you invoked.

## Updating
This project will update once every 1~2 week since 2021/9/1 to solve bugs and develop new features.
